## Reflection

After brainstorming these three ideas, answer the following:

1. **Which idea are you most excited about?** Why?

2. **Which idea seems most feasible?** What makes it achievable?

3. **What concerns do you have?** (technical challenges, time constraints, etc.)

4. **Do you have any questions for the instructor?**
